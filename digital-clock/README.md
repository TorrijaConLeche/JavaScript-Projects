## Just a Digital Clock

It's just a digital clock which shows time, date and can be configured with different time zones.

Did it to learn about Date() object and its methods. 

You can view and example [here](https://java-script-projects-ten.vercel.app/digital-clock)

### Aspects to consider:

1. Update de clock automatically.

2. Configure several time zones.

3. Don't copy my code, I'm just a noobie :D
