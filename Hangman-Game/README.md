## Hangman Game

The main idea of the project is to develop the classical hangman game in which the player tries words and letters with the goal to guess the word.

You can use the hangman images and words from the **content** folder and **words.js** file .

Words and images from [jlbooker](https://github.com/jlbooker/hangman) 

You can view and example [here](https://java-script-projects-ten.vercel.app/Hangman-Game)

### Aspects to consider:

1. The player must be able to see words and letters already tried.

2. The player will see the word if he loses the game.

3. You can add extra languages to make it more fun.

4. Don't copy my code, I'm just a noobie :D
