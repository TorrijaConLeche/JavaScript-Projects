## Pokemon Card Generator

The idea behind this project is to practice connections with APIs, in this case I'm using [PokeAPI.co](https://pokeapi.co/). 

After creating the preset card with the API data, we will be developing an interface in which the user can customize the card.

You can view and example [here](https://java-script-projects-ten.vercel.app/card-generator)

### Aspects to consider:

1. Data will be shown dynamically with the API.

2. The user can customize the card.

3. Try to add an option to copy the code so the user can embed the card in any website.

4. Don't copy my code, I'm just a noobie :D
