## Epic Memory Game

Typical memory game with cards. I struggled a lot with this one, enjoy it :D

### Aspects to consider:

1. You will create a button to randomize cards so the user can play a new game.

2. Use the number of rows and columns that you want (recommend you grid).

3. The user can see the amount of failed and successful attempts.

4. The user will be notified if he wins.

5. Don't copy my code, I'm just a noobie :D

### Ideas to make it more complex:

- Add more cards to the game

- Add winning effect i.e confetti library

- Loading bar while randomizing

- Add difficulty levels
