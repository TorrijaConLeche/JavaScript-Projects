## About this Repo

I've created this repository to share vanilla JavaScript projects that I'm developing while learning.

The idea with this repository is to share with the community different projects for people who are learning JavaScript like me.

In the README.md of each project you will find the instructions of the project so you can try to develop it on your own.

Disclaimer: I'm starting with JavaScript, that means the code is probably buggy :D
