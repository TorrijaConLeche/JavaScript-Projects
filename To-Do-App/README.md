## To Do App

The main idea of the project is to develop a simple application that allows a user to create notes.

The user will be able to delete these notes and mark them as completed or pending.

### Aspects to consider:

1. The user will not be able to create empty notes.

2. The user must be able to delete all the notes in a single click.

3. The input field must be empty after each note added.

4. Style doesn't matter, just focus on JavaScript.

5. Don't copy my code, I'm just a noobie :D
