## Epic Vowel Counter

The main idea of the project is to develop a simple application in which the user can input text and know how many vowels the text has.

### Aspects to consider:

1. The user will see a summary with the number of times each vowel is repeated as well as the total number of vowels.

2. The user cannot leave the input field empty.

3. The input field must be empty after each submit.

4. You can use **textarea** element or just **input**.

5. Don't copy my code, I'm just a noobie :D
